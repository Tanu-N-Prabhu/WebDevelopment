    Google Colaboratory is a research tool for data science and machine learning. It’s a jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use. It is by far one of the most top tools especially for data scientists because you don’t have to manually install all the packages and libraries, just import them directly by calling them. Whereas in normal IDE you have to manually install the libraries. And moreover notebooks are meant for code and explanation, it often should look like a blog post. I have been using Google colab from past two months and it has been the best tool for me. In this blog, I would be giving you guys some tips and tricks about mastering the Google Colab. Stay tuned read all the points, these were the features which even I was struggling to implement at the first place, now I mastered it. Let’s see the top best features of Google Colab notebook.

    Even though this tutorial is small, but it’s a good way to start on small things and get our hands dirty later on. I will make sure that everyone with no prior experience in python programming or don’t know what is data science or data cleaning can easily understand this tutorial. I did not know python in the first place, so even for me, this was a good place to start. One thing with python is that the code is self-explanatory, your focus should not be what the code does, because the code pretty much says what it does, rather you should tell why did you choose to do this, the “why” factor is important than the “what” factor.

    The list is a data structure in Python which acts as a container to hold or store multiple data at the same time. Lists are mutable or changeable and ordered sequence of elements. To know more about Python Lists you can visit the official Python Lists documentation. One thing you have to keep in mind is that often we must declare lists using [ ] brackets. The elements inside the [ ] are the values of the list.

You can search for any professor or school and get their ratings before taking or joining to their courses. It’s a handy feature which helps to know more about your professor or the university that you want to join. In this tutorial, we shall see how to scrape and to extract a specific professor’s tag. I warn you guys this is not illegal but the mass scraping of data from the website can lead your IP address being blocked. Just do it once or twice, but don’t just foolishly put it in a loop and try to put request inside the loop.

    I have chosen to scrape two YouTube accounts, named “PewDiePie” and “T-Series,” and report the subscriber difference. I have been a diehard fan of PewDiePie for the past 4 years, and he was the number one YouTuber in terms of his subscribers, up until the last six to ten months. At this point, T-series arrived and eventually outperformed and dethroned PewDiePie, setting a record and becoming the most subscribed channel (apart from YouTube’s own music channel). I did not like T-Series taking over, or how the sub-gap between T-Series and PewDiePie continues to increase drastically. In addition, this subscription gap was one of the biggest controversies in YouTube’s history, which is another reason why I chose to scrape this data. I have a strong feeling that eventually PewDiePie will surpass T-Series again, and remain as the number one YouTuber forever. Scraping these accounts and determining the subscriber gap will allow me to state with accuracy how close PewDiePie is to regain the title of the most subscribed YouTuber.

    Exploratory Data Analysis or (EDA) is understanding the data sets by summarizing their main characteristics often plotting them visually. This step is very important especially when we arrive at modeling the data in order to apply Machine learning. Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot and many more. It often takes much time to explore the data. Through the process of EDA, we can ask to define the problem statement or definition on our data set which is very important.

        Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed and general-purpose programming language. I know that I have used some vague terms let me clarify it. Cross-platform: It means that the system or the product can work across multiple platforms or operating system environments. For example Microsoft Excel, Word, Powerpoint works on both Windows and Macintosh Operating systems. Statically typed: Statically typed means that the variables used in the program must explicitly be declared along with their types (data type). For example, C, Java, Kotlin and many more are statically typed. Consider the below C programming code for statically typed programming.

  PewDiePie is a Swedish YouTuber and has 100 million subscribers on YouTube (He is my favorite). He gains thousands of subscribers every day, so I thought of writing a tutorial about his gain in subscribers. So I wanted to show you guys a practical implementation of Machine Learning’s Linear Regression Algorithm. Here we can apply linear regression to predict his daily YouTube subscribers. I will guide you guys throughout this tutorial how to do so. The entire code for this tutorial can be found on my GitHub. I will not explain the theory behind linear regression algorithms, because, according to me, the theory is not so important only the implementation is very important, because you need to know how and where to apply the algorithm.

  Data Science, as you all know, it is the process involved in studying the data. Yes, all you got to do is study the data and get new insights from the data. Here there is no need to focus on applying from scratch or learning new algorithms, all you need to know is learn how to approach the data and solve the problem. One of the key things that you need to know is using appropriate libraries to solve a data science problem. This article is all about providing the context to the important libraries used in Data Science. Before dwelling into the topic I would like to introduce the 5 primitive steps involved in solving a data science problem. Now I have sat down and designed these steps from scratch, so there is no right or wrong answer, the correct answer depends on how you approach the data.

  So friends let us learn all the things that you need to get started before actually coding in python and what all things that you need to know to become a good python programmer, what resources you need to master the programming language. This is not a coding tutorial, I will not be teaching you guys how to code in Python, rather I will share you some ideas, resources brief through some steps that you need to follow to become a good programmer. I’ll try not to make you feel bored, I’ll provide you with all the links of tutorials, books, GitHub repositories, and many more. Because it doesn’t matter how you learn the content but all that matters is whether you know the concepts. Don’t worry for all those beginners who have never coded in python before this tutorial is mainly for you, because this is the right place to get started. I will give you insights about my experience and make you master python programming. I’m again repeating this is not a coding tutorial because I cannot teach you python from scratch in one stretch, however, I will provide you enough content to get you started.

  Before starting let me quickly tell about the pandas data frame: It is a python library that provides high performance, and easy-to-use data structure for data analysis tools for python programming language. Below is an article that explains the primitive manipulations performed on the pandas data frame.
