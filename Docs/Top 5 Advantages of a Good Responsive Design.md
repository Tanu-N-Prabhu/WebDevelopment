# Introduction
## What is a Responsive design?
Well, to be clear and concise, the design that ***renders/displays*** the web pages ***perfectly*** or ***precisely*** on screens with different ***aspect ratios*** is referred to as responsive design. Now aspect ratio of a display screen means the correlation between width and height. Enough of the gibber jabber, let’s see an example of responsive design. [Ethan Marcotte’s website](https://responsivedesign.is/examples/ethan-marcotte/) is a good example of responsive design as seen below.

## Mobile versus Desktop user usage from October 2009 — October 2016
Now, sometimes you might think “***Should I always make my website responsive***” or “***What if my website would be used primarily on desktops or laptops***”. Well, let me tell you this, according to [broadbandsearch’s](https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/mobile-desktop-internet-usage-statistics#:~:text=53%20percent%20of%20web%20traffic,56.7%20percent%20from%20desktop%20users.) statistics report states that from October 2009–2016 the internet usage by ***Desktop was 48.7% and Mobile was 51.3%***.

The usage of the internet on mobile devices would be increased by 2020, because of the trend seen in the above internet usage graph. So keep in mind, your website will be accessed both on desktop and mobile devices.

## How to make a website responsive?
Well, the answer is pretty trivial and straightforward. There are many ways to do this, but the simplest way is to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): the most popular HTML, CSS, and Javascript library used to build responsive, mobile-first front-end web applications. To install it all you have to do is type the following the below command:


```
npm install bootstrap@next
```

Read the official installation docs given below to know more about it.

[Download](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/)

Or you can also refer to Google’s docs given below to build responsive websites as well.

Having separate websites for different platforms (devices) would automatically increase the cost of development. So why not have a single responsive website, wherein the cost of development would be really low. Also, you won’t be wasting your precision time and resources as well. Here are the golden words that are worth noting down.


> With a single responsive website you can fabricate a single web asset which fits all devices irrespective of their aspect ratios with minimal cost.

Let’s first understand the meaning of SEO. It stands for ***Search Engine Optimization*** — a process that increases the visibility of your website on search engines like ***Google, Bing, Microsoft Edge***, etc by displaying it at the top of the search results. Keep this in mind, the better visibility your website has in the search results, the more traffic or views you are going to get. Now to read more about SEO and it’s working please refer to [searchengineland.com](https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-seo)

> Responsive design is Google’s recommended design pattern — [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/mobile-sites/mobile-seo#select-config)


The key to improving your ***SEO*** is making your website responsive. Now, if you want to win Google’s heart, then aim for responsiveness. This is because of two major reasons.

1. All the responsive websites have a single URL irrespective of devices. So this makes Google rank or index the website efficiently.

2. Similarly, with just one URL sharing, the website becomes a lot easier, rather than having 10 different URLs for different devices.


> In websites, content plays a prominent role, often great content that is regularly updated improves our search engine ranking or index positioning.
