# Responsive Images
Responsive images are those images that fit well to the screens, irrespective of their aspect ratios. Responsive images will naturally change in accordance by adjusting to the screen. A perfect responsive image should fit and easily be visible when you minimize the desktop screens or even use a smartphone with any resolutions (meaning you donâ€™t need to scroll up-down or left-right to see the entire image). For example, refer to the below example for better understanding.

As you can see, the same image (human on a kayak) fits very well with all four devices (desktop, laptop, smartphone, tablet) irrespective of their displays as illustrated above.
