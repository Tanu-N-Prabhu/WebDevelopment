Connecting with users is not just talking to users over the phone, or online meetings, or even meeting them personally. We need to develop a deep understanding of the users lives and their unmet needs. Just remember these three words ***Empathy → Sympathy → Apathy*** before designing any product. As we all know that design thinking is not just thinking in terms of design, whereas it is “The ideology which asserts hands-on, user-centric approach to problem-solving can lead to innovation, and innovation can lead to differentiation and competitive advantage” — [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/). The first step in the design thinking process is “Empathize”. Don’t believe me read this [article](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/design-thinking/) and then judge me. Empathize is nothing but to conduct research and to develop a deep understanding of users.


## How do we perform empathize?
This can be achieved by using “**Empathy Maps**”. This is a visualization that articulates what we know about the user. Using the empathy maps we can connect with the user:

* We can listen to what they Say
* We can watch what they do
* We can ask them how they feel
* We can ask them what they think

The words such as Says, Does, Feels, and Thinks are actually the four quadrants of the Empathy Map.

Sometimes the empathy map is not only given for the users to collect feedback. Also, the designers think in terms of the user's perspective and note down the possible questions. In the real world, empathy maps are often represented and described using sticky notes. The designers whenever they get new possible questions about the product, write it down on the sticky note and paste it on the wall or the board.

## Example of an empathy map
I have recently completed my Human-Computer Communication graduate course. Here in the initial classes, my professor gave us our first assignments, wherein we had to draw empathy maps on our university website (University of Regina). The name of the university website is [URCourses](https://www.uregina.ca/urcourses/). The question of the assignment was “***Creating an Empathy Map as a Teacher on University of Regina Courses application***”. You can take this example as a reference and then draw similar empathy maps in the future if you are asked. You might not be able to access the website because it’s only for university students to access the grades, courses, and material, and many more for the semester. But just learn the way to draw it initially.
