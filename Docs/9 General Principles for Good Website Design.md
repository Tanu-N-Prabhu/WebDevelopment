# Quick Summary

Designing a good website is often challenging and hard. There may be billions and billions of websites out there only a few thousand of them are mostly good websites. People spend a lot of time on the internet for shopping, ordering food online, exploring their university websites, reading articles from different websites and many more. You can make a user’s day bad just by designing a bad website. It’s time to change. If you are on the verge of designing a website or already have a website and thinking to update your crappy website, this article is totally for you. Don’t worry I got you. I was sailing on the same boat too. So throughout the tutorial, I want you guys to follow two big quotes regarding design.

> **Steve Jobs**: Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

> **Jakobs Law**: Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

# How to design a good website?
Well, good website design often comes from different expert areas. It’s not a one-step process, you can never design good websites from shortcut steps. After taking a graduate class named “***Human-Computer Communication***” we had a long discussion in the class after which we came up with the 9 general principles with the help of which you can improve or design good websites (It's like a formula of design). We should always focus on these key aspects i.e. [Usability](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability) and [User Experience](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design) for designing a website. Follow the below discussed 9 general principles and make your websites usable, aesthetic, friendly, engaging to use.

## 1. Easy Navigation
This is one of the most important features or a principle that you must keep in mind and implement while you are designing a website. According to the survey conducted by [Clutch](https://clutch.co/web-designers/resources/top-6-website-features-people-value), they found that “***Almost everyone (94%) says easy navigation is the most important website feature***”. It’s true because if your site is hard to navigate, nothings easily available in the first place, then things might not go smoothly. **Easy navigation includes a simple menu layout and the ability to quickly and reliably move through sites**. Don’t worry I have some tips for easy website navigation.

* Keep the ***navigation bar*** as simple as possible with ***minimal options***
* ***Mitigate*** the drop-down menu options
* Follow ***real-world conventions*** or use the user’s language for naming the options. Don’t use jargons
* Avoid ***too many clicks*** inside the website.

***Motivate***, ***learn*** and ***teach*** yourself how to implement the above tips by looking at some of the best websites available out there. For example, [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) — Google. I will use the same example in most of this tutorial. Because why not it’s one of the best website/application on the planet.
