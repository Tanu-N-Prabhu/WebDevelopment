# Quick Summary

Designing a good website is often challenging and hard. There may be billions and billions of websites out there only a few thousand of them are mostly good websites. People spend a lot of time on the internet for shopping, ordering food online, exploring their university websites, reading articles from different websites and many more. You can make a user’s day bad just by designing a bad website. It’s time to change. If you are on the verge of designing a website or already have a website and thinking to update your crappy website, this article is totally for you. Don’t worry I got you. I was sailing on the same boat too. So throughout the tutorial, I want you guys to follow two big quotes regarding design.

> **Steve Jobs**: Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

> **Jakobs Law**: Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.

# How to design a good website?
Well, good website design often comes from different expert areas. It’s not a one-step process, you can never design good websites from shortcut steps. After taking a graduate class named “***Human-Computer Communication***” we had a long discussion in the class after which we came up with the 9 general principles with the help of which you can improve or design good websites (It's like a formula of design). We should always focus on these key aspects i.e. [Usability](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/usability) and [User Experience](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/ux-design) for designing a website. Follow the below discussed 9 general principles and make your websites usable, aesthetic, friendly, engaging to use.

## 1. Easy Navigation
This is one of the most important features or a principle that you must keep in mind and implement while you are designing a website. According to the survey conducted by [Clutch](https://clutch.co/web-designers/resources/top-6-website-features-people-value), they found that “***Almost everyone (94%) says easy navigation is the most important website feature***”. It’s true because if your site is hard to navigate, nothings easily available in the first place, then things might not go smoothly. **Easy navigation includes a simple menu layout and the ability to quickly and reliably move through sites**. Don’t worry I have some tips for easy website navigation.

* Keep the ***navigation bar*** as simple as possible with ***minimal options***
* ***Mitigate*** the drop-down menu options
* Follow ***real-world conventions*** or use the user’s language for naming the options. Don’t use jargons
* Avoid ***too many clicks*** inside the website.

***Motivate***, ***learn*** and ***teach*** yourself how to implement the above tips by looking at some of the best websites available out there. For example, [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/) — Google. I will use the same example in most of this tutorial. Because why not it’s one of the best website/application on the planet.

## 2. Responsive design
First, let’s get the basics ready. Responsive design means the design of a website/webpage that fits well with all the smartphones, computers, laptops or any display devices irrespective of their aspect ratios. An aspect ratio is the ***height*** and ***width*** of a display device. Every user today wants a mobile version of the website. It is the duty of the designer not only to design the website for a bigger screen but also focus on the smaller screens too. The website should not work only for a specific iPhone, Blackberry (if that’s a thing today), Samsung and One Plus phones. The design should fit every single smartphone available in the market. Well, if not every smartphone, at least try to. Some tips for responsive design are:

* ***Optimize*** the images
* nsure ***buttons*** can be easily clicked on smaller screens
* Create ***several prototypes***
* Consider a ***Mobile-first*** design approach

> ***Hint***: If you need your to design to be the best then follow:
> Understand → Explore → Prototype → Evaluate
Now you guys might have heard this term before a million times “***Mobile-first design approach***”. There are some design requirements in this approach which are listed below:

* Providing ***less content*** on the screen and focus on important details
* The ***text size*** should be appropriate
* Provide ***better interactive elements***
* Telling the ***customers*** you want them
* ***Client Squish Media*** (keeping the aspect ratio in mind while designing)
