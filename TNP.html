    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p align = "justify">This is me, I'm doing my Master's in Computer Science, at University of Regina, Canada. Although I'm good at programming, definitely not a code monkey. I like to document each and every line of code and help others understand it. It is very important to document the code. I believe that I learn simultaneously while I also teach. Hence I write tutorials and critique other works and improve it. I stay in Luther College Residence at the Universiy of Regina. Originally I'm from Bangalore.</p>

    <p align = "justify">
    At the age of 5 Tanu started his school "St Miras High School" which was in Rajajinagar, and was located literally next street of his residence. During his school days Tanu was a really good student both in terms of his academics and his attitude. Most of his class teachers still remember his name. He graduated his school when he was at grade 10, and he was one of the top ten students in his school. During his childhood Tanu did not had any good or best friends, so he did not show any intrest in making friends. He is continuig the same thing even today. Tanu graduated his school with a good marks and all the credit goes to his mom because she spent most of her life in teaching and making him good at his studies, eventough tanu was good in his studies a bit of fine tuning was required, you know we are human beings we make mistakes, so his mistakes was corrected by his mom. One thing I have to admit is that Tanu's Handwriting is just amazing, again credit goes to his mom. His mom made him to write 5 pages in a day on a four lined book to improve his handwriting, even a slight mistake would cause him to rewrite the whole page again. This is how tanu's handwriting became so good. Tanu graduated from his school in 2012

    After graduating from his school, Tanu then joined KLE Independent PU College to continue his studies, he took a major in PCMC (Physics, Chemistry, Maths and Computer Science). That was a fairly good college, even here Tanu maintaied a good reputation. This was where he entered into the field of computer science. Tanu for the whole year did not go to his classes during saturdays even though saturday was a working day. Rather he used to study in his home. Although he was very intrested in computer science, his professors did not teach the subject very well, they always focused on the theory, definitions and nothing about programming and practicles. So he ended up just memorizing the definitions and lab programs. Tanu was very good in maths during those days, he used to solve each and every problem when given as an assignment on the same day. He used to practice hard for all his exams, and he used to argue with his professors by asking them really hard questions, most of the time the questions started with <b>"Why"</b>, because he was very curious in knowing the answers. He ended up getting a good marks in pre uinversity exams as well. Tanu graduated from his pre-university from 2014

Here Tanu was recognised as one of the best student in the entire college, and he was made as the "Brand Ambassador of the College".  Also in his 3 semester he was the third topper for the entire computer science department. Almost all the computer science teacher loved tanu upto a very great extent, some of them even contact him. Especially the principal of the college is tanu's best mentor, he even speaks with tanu.

    After graduating from Global Academy of Technology, Tanu then followed his dream of studying Master in Computer Science, so he then started applying to all the universities across Canada. Accoring to tanu's profile he applied for best 8 university in canada including Queens, University of Saskatchewan, Dalhousie, University of Ottawa, University of Regina and 3 more. Then he got acceptance from almost 6 university, and then he finalized to go to University of Regina to pursue his master course.

This is where tanu carrer took a new form, this is where he started to lead a independent life, and started to know more about him and the world. This was the starting point of a new life for Tanu, he discovered his inner abilities to write about programming tutorials, he is now the author of 5 publications such as Towards Data Science, Kotlin Academy, Startup, Analytica Vidhya, Data Science from Scratch. He started to write in the month of July and till now he has written over 20 articles and gained more than 100, 000 view and 345 follows with in a short period of time.
